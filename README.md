## CIA-I

The CIA-1 folder consists of a recommendation system enabled by the multi_-arm bandit algorithm. More details can be foind in the README.


## CIA-II

The MazeAlg folder consists of the different Temporal-Difference Learning (TDL) algorithms applied on a 5x5, 10x10 and a 100x100 maze.
The four algorithms applied are:-
- SARSA(0) & SARSA(n)
- Q(0) & Q(n)

Both algorithms were tested with both a greedy policy and the $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm.
